<h2>The beggining of the end</h2>

<h3>THE ASSASINATION</h3>
<p>Basically, the heir to the Austrian-Hungarian thronee was Arch Duke Franz Ferdinand and one day he decided to go on a small holiday. However he needed to cross Serbia. Serbia and Austria-Hungary are rivals that both wanted to rule Bonsia. While he was in Serbian territory, a Serbian man shot Ferdinand and killed him, because the Serbian man believed Bonsia should be controlled by Serbia. This killing that was out of rage and anger, provoked the Austria-Hungary and due to them not having an heir to the throne, Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia</p>
