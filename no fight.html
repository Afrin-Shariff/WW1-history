<h1>NOT WILLING TO FIGHT</h1>
<p>Many people in Britian at the start of theh war did not want to fight and some wanted to have nothing to do with the war. There were quite a few reasons for why not to fight, but if you didn't fight then you would be classed as unworthy of life and a disgrace to society.</p>
