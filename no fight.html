<h1>NOT WILLING TO FIGHT</h1>
<p>Many people in Britian at the start of theh war did not want to fight and some wanted to have nothing to do with the war. There were quite a few reasons for why not to fight, but if you didn't fight then you would be classed as unworthy of life and a disgrace to society.</p>
<h2>WHY?</h2>
<p>CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTERS - some people refused to fight because of their religion</p>
<p>PREFERENCE - some men would rather be in a non-combat role but they still wanted to participate in the war and so they took on roles like trench diggers or ambulance drivers.</p>
<p>MEDICAL REASONS - many people had a medical issue and so they could't fight, examples might be 1 leg or a severe heart disease.</p>
<h3>WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM</h3>
<p>Before conscription came in, they were named as weak or useless, and some of them were imprisoned, and some of them were forced to do hard labour.</p>
