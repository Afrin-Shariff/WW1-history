<h1>BATTLES</h1>
<p>During ww1, many battles took place as well as the main fighting. Some of the most notable battles are the battle of somme, Battle of Jutland and submarines.</p>
<p><strong>BATTLE OF SOMME</strong> - It was one of the deadliest battles in history, with over 1 million men were wounded/injured. The first day of the battle saw the British Army suffer 57,470 casualties.</p>
<p><strong>BATTLE OF JUTLAND</strong> - The biggest battle at sea was the battle of jutland. It was between the british and germans. However, there was no clear winner making both nations even more annoyed.</p>
<p><strong>SUBMARINE BATTLES</strong> - It wasn't exactly an official battle, but if it was then germany would have won. This was becuase all the food import ships that were coming in to britian, were being sunk by german U-BOATS/SUBMARINES. Germany sunk almost 5000 ships and almost 20,000 toms of food were gone.</p>
