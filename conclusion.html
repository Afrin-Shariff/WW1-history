<h1>HOW FAR DID LIFE CHANGE FOR:</h1>
<h4>A) SOLDIERS ON THE WESTERN FRONT</h4>
<h4>B) CIVILIANS ON THE HOME FRONT</h4>

<p>Life for <strong>SOLDIERS ON THE WESTERN FRONT</strong> during World War I changed drastically. The daily routine was grueling and dangerous. Soldiers lived in muddy, rat-infested trenches, facing constant threats from artillery, machine guns, and sniper fire. They dealt with extreme weather conditions, disease, and the psychological toll of constant combat. This ws also a negative change, as soldiers were under consistent threat and their new homes were as uncomfortable as sleeping on a pile of rocks.</p>
<p>Life for <strong>CIVILIANS ON THE HOMEFRONT</strong> had altered especially when it came to the significant economic changes. Food shortages were common as agricultural production declined and transportation routes were disrupted1. Civilians had to deal with rationing, long queues for basic necessities, and the black market for scarce goods. Women often took on roles traditionally held by men, working in factories and other industries to support the war effort. This is also a very negative change. However, ww1 had poured the fuel and handed the government the matches when it came to allowing women to vote. This was posittive so even though lives changed excessively, there was a small positive. Maybe about 5%.</p>
