    <h3>MEDICINE</h3>
    <p>Medicine during WW1 was not as developed as today and mental illnesses were taken as a sign of weakness. If you were ill or injured then you would be categorised into 1 of the 4 categories of the TRIAGE.</p>
    <h4>TRIAGE</h4>
    <p>The triage was a way of deciding your next actions after you've had an injury. You next actions are based on your seriousness of your injury.</p>
    <h7>LEVEL 1</h7>
    <p>TRIVIAL - Soldiers with minor injuries were treated quickly and returned to the front line.</p>
    <p>SERIOUS - These included wounds that necessitated advanced medical care but were not immediately life-threatening</p>
    <p>CRITICAL - This stage is for soldiers that needed medical attention ASAP. They were rushed to the neaarest field or proper hospital, but this would only apple if they had a chance of survival.</p>
    <p>BEYOND HELP - This is the last stage where soldiers are critical, but they have around 5%-no chance of survival. If this is the case then these soldiers are given the most comfort possible and they write one last letter to any relatives.</p>
