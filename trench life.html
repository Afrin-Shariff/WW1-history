<h1>WHAT WAS A TRENCH</h1>
<p>Trenches were designed to protect soldiers from machine-gun fire and artillery attacks. They were also used to shelter soldiers from chemical warfare, such as poison gas1. The area between opposing trench lines was known as "no man's land," which was fully exposed to artillery fire and extremely dangerous.</p>
<p>Tranches were built in a zig zag pattern so if there is a bomb in one area it would be contained easily and it would keep colatteral damage to a minimum. Also, if there was an intruder from the other side somehow, then it would be harrder for them. Also, many snipers would be aiming and if they see someone put there head up then they will take the shot somewhere around the head. This means they would probably be taking a shot at an imaginery body. However, trenches were around 12 feet into the ground so they would easily be able to take cover.</p>
