<h1>WHAT WAS A TRENCH</h1>
<p>Trenches were designed to protect soldiers from machine-gun fire and artillery attacks. They were also used to shelter soldiers from chemical warfare, such as poison gas1. The area between opposing trench lines was known as "no man's land," which was fully exposed to artillery fire and extremely dangerous.</p>
<p>Tranches were built in a zig zag pattern so if there is a bomb in one area it would be contained easily and it would keep colatteral damage to a minimum. Also, if there was an intruder from the other side somehow, then it would be harrder for them. Also, many snipers would be aiming and if they see someone put there head up then they will take the shot somewhere around the head. This means they would probably be taking a shot at an imaginery body. However, trenches were around 12 feet into the ground so they would easily be able to take cover.</p>
<h2>CONDITIONS</h2>
<p>CROWDED - Trenches were very deep bu not that wide and millions of soldiers lived in trenches so it was really crowded.</p>
<p>FOOD RATIONS - Once food ran out in the trenches, you couldnt just go to lidl and buy lasagna or order on just eat if your a bit lazy. You wouldn't even have lasagna :(. You would be rationed to a very small bit of food </p>
<p>COLD - Unfortunately the soldiers didnt get personal heaters that are portable, instead they got the cold. this caused many conditions that affected people, includeing FROSTBITE.</p>
<p>WET - They didn't really have hair dryers to dry the floor, so they were stuck with the wet. When it rained, many trenches started to flood as the water just dripped into them like a bucket. The after effects made sure that the rain would not be forgotten. It also caused medical conditions like TRENCH FOOT</p>
<p>PESTS - Trenches were 12 feet deep, so they got to share their new homes with rats, mice and lice. Also rats and mice eat the people that have died on the no man's land. They also easily spread diseases like TYPHUS.</p>
<p>DIRTY & MUDDY - Because the trenches are so deep in the ground and cause it was WW1 you couldn't exaclty bring out your Flash-speed mop, or your henry hoover, you had to deal with it.</p>
<p>UNCOMFORTABLE - trenches were muddy, dirty, narrow and a dozen feet into the ground. It doesn't exactly scream comfortable. You did not have your double bed with plush silk pillow and sleep with it. You had the hard, bumpy floor.</p>
