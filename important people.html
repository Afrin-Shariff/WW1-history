        <h1>IMPORTANT PEOPLE</h1>
        <p>From growing it to saving others, whether we talk about woman, children, men, kings, MPs, the rich, the poor, or even just the common man, everyone played their part in the war. However, some people had a more significant impact compared to others.</p>
        <h2>NAMES:</h2>
        <h3>ARCHDUKE FRANZ FERDINAND</h3>
        <p>INFO</p>
        <p>Born on December 18, 1863, in Graz, Austria and died on June 28, 1914, in Sarajevo was a transformative figure in the Austrian-Hungarian Empire. As heir presumptive, he championed military modernisation and rose swiftly to become a major general by 31. His 1913 appointment as Inspector General of the Army underscored his commitment to strengthening the empire. Beyond his military prowess, his morganatic marriage to Sophie Chotek and their three children highlighted his dedication to both duty and family, leaving an indelible mark on the empire's legacy.</p>
        <p>HOW IS HE INVOLVED WITH THE WAR?</p>
        <p>Archduke Franz Ferdinand's involvement in World War 1 is pivotal due to his assassination. As the heir presumptive to the Austro-Hungarian throne, his death on June 28, 1914, in Sarajevo by Gavrilo Princip, a member of the nationalist group Young Bosnia, set off a chain of events that led to the outbreak of the war. This assassination triggered the July Crisis, which ultimately resulted in Austria-Hungary declaring war on Serbia, pulling in various alliances and igniting the global conflict</p>
        <h4>LORD KITCHENER</h4>
        <p>INFO</p>
        <p>Lord Kitchener, born on June 24, 1850, in County Kerry, Ireland and died on June 5, 1916 was a renowned British Army officer and colonial administrator. He achieved fame for his decisive victories in Sudan and the Second Boer War, notably the Battle of Omdurman. Kitchener's strategic brilliance earned him titles like Baron Kitchener of Khartoum, marking him as a crucial figure in British military history.</p>        
	    <p>HOW IS HE INVOLVED WITH THE WAR?</p>
        <p>Lord Horatio Kitchener, Also known as Earl Kitchener, played a significant role in the early years of World War 1. As Secretary of State for War, he organized the largest volunteer army in British history and oversaw a massive expansion of material production to support the war effort. He also had the job of creating recruitment posters to encourage people to fight and to get them/everyone else to believe that the trenches were a good place. Despite his foresight about the war's length, he faced criticism for the shell shortage in 1915 and was gradually stripped of his responsibilities.</p>
