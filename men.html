<h1>MEN'S ROLE IN THE WAR</h1>
<p>The role of a man back in the times of WW1, was to be the front line. At the start, men could decide if they wanted to fight in war or not, but after the start, the government realised how bad it was and they realised they needed more peolpe. By January 1916, men aged 18-41 had to fight in the war but only if they were single. Later that year, married men had to fight as well. However, fighting was not the only job there was. Many coal miners went on to build trenches and shelters for the soldiers as they already had experience in building and being extremely cautious.</p>
<h2>CONSCIENTOUS OBJECTERS</h2>
<p>Conscientous objecters is the name given to men who refused to fight on the bases of religion, moral, philosophy etc. </p>
