<h1>DORA</h1>
<p>First things first, this form of DORA does not mean dora the explorer. The Defence of the Realm Act (DORA) was introduced in the United Kingdom on August 8, 1914, just four days after the country entered World War I. Even though it says realms it does not mean the realms of asgard. It granted the government extensive powers to ensure national security, including censorship of the press, control over public gatherings, and restrictions on everyday activities like flying kites or buying binoculars2. DORA also allowed for the requisition of buildings and land for the war effort and imposed strict regulations on alcohol consumption. The act played a crucial role in maintaining public morale and preventing potential espionage or sabotage during the war</p>
