<h1>VOLUNTEERS</h1>
<p>Many men in WW1 had volunteered to fight in the war for numerous reasons, and many others wanted to have nothing to do with it. It was technically their own choice until January 1916.</p>
<h2>WHY TO FIGHT</h2>
<p> It can be questionable on why someone would be prepared to throw their life away just to fight in a war, but here are some of the key reasons.</p>
<p>1. PEER PRESSURE - if one person joined, then it is likely that they pressured their friends into doing it as well.</p>
<p>2. FOR FAMILY - they want their family to be safe and this will only happen if they win(by fighting).</p>
<p>3. HONOUR - they can be honoured as a saviour of the country and a hero. Communities will give them attention.</p>
<p>4. NOT COWARDs - many people thought that if they did not fight then they would be classed as a coward or a scared person.</p4>
<p>5. GOD - some people thought that they are doing this for god, because it is part of god's plan. Others thought that they would get a free ride to heaven if they sacrificed themselves during war.</p5>
<p>6. ADVENTURE & CURIOSITY - most people had not been outside of the town that they live in, and going to war meant that they get to travel. Some went to the west, some went to the east and even though you were fighting most of the time, it was worth it so that you could travel.</p>
<p>7. GIRLS - In that time, girls prefered men that would have been strong or ones that had proved their worth. If men went to fight then surely it would get them attention from girls</p>
<p>8. STEREOTYPES - It was a very common stereotype that if you're a boy then you won't fight and you can only be a man if you fight. Basically, the thought was if you fight then you're strong, if you don't then you're weak.</p>
