<h1>HOW DOES SOURCE A SHOW THE WAR?</h1>
<p>USEFUL -- Source A would be useful to a historian studying life in WW1 because it tells them about the trenchâ€™s soldiers fought in. Trenches were long holes in the ground to protect each side from opposing gunfire. The source is also useful because it shows the different weapons used in WW1. In the background of the image, we can see a tank with a machine-this was developed in WW1. This tells historians that there were inventions and technological developments. We can also see rifles which were given to the soldiers after they joined the British army. Even though the source is an advert for cigarettes, it is useful in showing how lots of companies make war look better than it was, due to pressures from the government, propaganda, and censorship.</p>
<P>NOT USEFUL -- However, source A has limits to its value because the source is not reliable =e in showing what life was like in the trenches. In the source, the soldiers are happy, laughing and carefree with very clean uniforms. We know this is not true as many soldiers suffered from shell shock and depression from fighting and bombings as well as being very muddy as they were exposed to all sorts of weather conditions. One man is also standing above the trench. This would have meant that he would have been killed by an enemy sniper. Another reason why the source is limited when it comes to usefulness is because the purpose of the advert was to make a profit. Therefore, they glamorized the war to make people want to buy cigarettes so that they can be like the heroic soldiers.</P>
<p>CONCLUSION -- Overall, I think this source is more limited compared to useful, because in war soldiers would be suffering not having a great time and someone would not put there head over the trench, because if they did then they would be killed instantly.</p>
