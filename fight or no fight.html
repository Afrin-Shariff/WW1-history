<h1>VOLUNTEERS</h1>
<p>Many men in WW1 had volunteered to fight in the war for numerous reasons, and many others wanted to have nothing to do with it. It was technically their own choice until January 1916.</p>
<h2>WHY TO FIGHT</h2>
<p> It can be questionable on why someone would be prepared to throw their life away just to fight in a war, but here are some of the key reasons.</p>
<p>1. PEER PRESSURE - if one person joined, then it is likely that they pressured their friends into doing it as well.</p>
<p>2. FOR FAMILY - they want their family to be safe and this will only happen if they win(by fighting).</p>
<p>3. HONOUR - they can be honoured as a saviour of the country and a hero. Communities will give them attention.</p>
<p>4. NOT COWARDs - many people thought that if they did not fight then they would be classed as a coward or a scared person.</p4>
<p>5. GOD - some people thought that they are doing this for god, because it is part of god's plan. Others thought that they would get a free ride to heaven if they sacrificed themselves during war.</p5>
<p>6. ADVENTURE & CURIOSITY - most people had not been outside of the town that they live in, and going to war meant that they get to travel. Some went to the west, some went to the east and even though you were fighting most of the time, it was worth it so that you could travel.</p>
<p>7. GIRLS - In that time, girls prefered men that would have been strong or ones that had proved their worth. If men went to fight then surely it would get them attention from girls</p>
<p>8. STEREOTYPES - It was a very common stereotype that if you're a boy then you won't fight and you can only be a man if you fight. Basically, the thought was if you fight then you're strong, if you don't then you're weak.</p>
<p>9. PATRIOTISM - Some people thought that they had a duty to their country and so they fought to prove it</p>
<h2>PALS BATTALIONS</h2>
<p>Pals batallions is a term that is used to describe a group of people who fought in the war. However, this group of people were friends from before and they all lived in the same town, area, or city.</p>

<h1>NOT WILLING TO FIGHT</h1>
<p>Many people in Britian at the start of theh war did not want to fight and some wanted to have nothing to do with the war. There were quite a few reasons for why not to fight, but if you didn't fight then you would be classed as unworthy of life and a disgrace to society.</p>
<h2>WHY?</h2>
<p>CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTERS - some people refused to fight because of their religion</p>
<p>PREFERENCE - some men would rather be in a non-combat role but they still wanted to participate in the war and so they took on roles like trench diggers or ambulance drivers.</p>
<p>MEDICAL REASONS - many people had a medical issue and so they could't fight, examples might be 1 leg or a severe heart disease.</p>
<h3>WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM</h3>
<p>Before conscription came in, they were named as weak or useless, and some of them were imprisoned, and some of them were forced to do hard labour.</p>
