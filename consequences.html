<h1>CONSEQUENCES</h1>
<p>The CONSEQUENCES of World War I were profound and far-reaching, reshaping the global landscape in countless ways. The war led to significant political upheavals, with the fall of empires such as the Ottoman, Austro-Hungarian, German, and Russian. Economically, it devastated many nations, leading to widespread poverty and the reallocation of resources. Socially, the war brought about a shift in societal norms, including the roles of women, who entered the workforce in unprecedented numbers. The immense human cost, with millions of lives lost, left deep scars and a collective trauma that shaped the interwar period and laid the groundwork for future conflicts.</p>
<p>DEBT AND DEPRESSION - Lots of europe was in debt to the USA and nation's economics went down severly causing the great depression.</p>
<p>POLITICAL CHAOS - Old empires had collapsed (e.g. Ottoman) causing instability for certain communities and societies</p>
<p>DEATH AND DESTRUCTION - Many soldiers and innocent people had died and because in the last year of the war, the spanish flu broke out then the spread of troops and deaceased people and unhygenic conditions, the spanish flu unravelled its potential and killed more people than the war itself</p>
<p>BITTERNESS AND BLAME - Many nations that lost were angry and were looking for a scapegoat. For the germans and Adolf Hitler it was the jewish causing a WW2. This was a chain-reaction.</p>
<h1>MAYBE NOT SO BAD AFTER ALL</h1>
<p>"Out of the mud and blood of the trenches rose a new generation with dreams of peace and progress." is what I would like to say. Basically we just need to look on the positive side to see some insights.</p>
<p>TECHNOLOGICAL AND MEDICINAL ADVANCEMENTS - The war accelerated advancements in technology and medicine. Innovations such as tanks, airplanes, and chemical warfare emerged, and medical practices improved due to the need to treat large numbers of wounded soldiers1.</p>
<P>ALLOWED PEOPLE TO LEARN FROM DISCRIMINATION - If www1 led to ww2 and ww2 started on the basis of discrimination then when it ended people learnt to not discriminate or else there will be ww3. This means that they technically learnt from ww1 not to discriminate because ww2 came from ww1. This is called indirect chain-reaction</p>

<p>Technically due to the reasons above, the war wasn't all that bad. I mean don't get me wrong, it was absolutely devasting, traumatic, outraging and gruesome but the thing in the war that hurt the most wasn't the deaths or destruction. It was when people lost hope. Losing Hope is the most painful thing in the world and sometimes losing hope means losing yourself and your glorious purpose. So if there is any negative consequence that is the worst, it is that people lost hope. And if there is any positive, it is that people learnt to hang on to that thin thread of hope. </p>
