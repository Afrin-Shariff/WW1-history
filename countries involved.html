<h2>COUNTRIES INVOLVED</h2>
<p>Before we discover any changes or living conditions, we must ask ourselves what countries where involved and what were the teams. In total more than 100 countries participated from all over the world. Any country was either on the team of Triple Entente or Triple alliance</p>
<h3>TRIPLE ENTENTE</h3>
<p>The triple entente originally contained Britian, Russia and France. These 3 natioons had signed a contract so they had to support eachother.</p>
<p>They had an okay number of troops, russia had one of the biggest and britian had the least.</p>
<h4>AMOUNT OF TROOPS</h4>
<p>RUSSIA - 5,971,000</p>
<p>FRANCE - 4,017,000</p>
<p>BRITIAN - 971,000</p>
<h5>TRIPLE ALLIANCE</h5>
<p>The triple alliance originally consisted of 3 countries, but this time it was Germnay, Italy and Austria-Hungary. In total this side had the most troops.</p>
<h5>AMOUNT OF TROOPS</h5>
<p>ITALY - 1,251,000</p>
<p>GERMANY - 4,500,000</P>
<p>AUSTRIA-HUNGARY - 3,000,000</p>
<h6>THE TRAITOR</h6>
<p>When Italy realised that austria-hungary was not fighting to their full potential and so when italy joined the war, they joined in with the allies against germany and austria-hungary. The triple alliance also provided italy with a deal that if they joined them then they wouold get a lot of regions to rule over.ITALY TOOK THE DEAL!!!</p>
