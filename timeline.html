<h2>TIMELINE!</h2>
<p>World War 1 included some pretty rough events but in the end i think the leaders of the france, german, american and british decided to go on a tour of france together in a railway cart.</p>
<p>In other words the 4 leaders decided to end the war. It was during a meeting and they met in a railway cariage so that no one would suspect anything. They decided that all sides had suffered to much and so they decided to end in in early noveber. However, all 4 of them decided that they want a date that could be remembered easily as the end of the world war so that people can respect the end and respect the people that fought for their countries. This is how they came up with 11/11. The 11/11 is easy to remember; as the date is all one's. they also decided to end it at 11.00am. this time is also made up of one's. Well, it was either that or everyone liked the number 1 because they thougt that they were the best and they always deserved 1st price.</p>
