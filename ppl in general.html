<h2>TOTAL WAR</h2>
<p>TOTAL WAR = This was the term that was used to describe the scale of the war and the devestation that it caused people.</p>
<h3>HOW DID LIVES ON THE HOMEFRONT CHANGE</h3>
<h5>FOOD SHORTAGES</h5>
<p><strong>WHY?</strong> Germany realised that they were not able to beat britian in arms, but they could beat them in hunger. A lot of Britian's food was delivered by boat so the germans got creative. They decided to use their faster and safer U-BOATS to sink britian's food suply boats when it comes in. This was successful and Britian starved</p>
<p><strong>WHAT WAS THE CHANGE</strong> Even with around 30,000 woman working on farms, there were food shortages.People were rationed when it came to meat, bread, sugar, cheese, and margarine.</p>
<h5>PROPAGANDA</h5>
<p><strong>WHY?</strong> The government did not want to put anything negative in any newspapers or no one would fight in the war and britain would lose.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT WAS THE CHANGE</strong> The government had the power to control the news so they made it full of good news. Most news papers where about how good it was to fight and fake glamour.</p>
<h5>AIR RAIDS</h5>
<p><strong>WHY?</strong> Many countries wanted to find more ways to win especially Germany, so they cam up with the idea of air raids</p>
<p><strong>WHAT WAS THE CHANGE</strong> Now simple civilians were in danger as well making britain fight harder. Houses could also be destroyed and this spread terror.</p>
