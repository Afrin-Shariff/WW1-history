<h1>WOMEN'S ROLE BEFORE WW1</h1>
<p>Before WW1, woman did not have much freedom and it was believed that their place was to stay at home. However, some rebelling woman went aginst the unspoken rules of society and decided to work. This was around 10% of women. Woman would have been stay at home mom, but before they got married there was a chance that they were maids, nannies for rich families or cleaners. Woman would not have even gon near any factories. Woman also had to sit on the fence(was not allowed to vote). In parliament they were treated like outsiders. They rarely protested because it was believed to be the way of life. Despite this a few groups called the suffragetes and the suffrigettes did petition and protest for the right to vote but these groups stopped at the start of the war.</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong> - woman had NO freedom, NO right to vote, MAINLY stayed at home. JOBS = cooking, cleaning, gentle, nurturing, children</p>
<h1>WOMAN'S ROLE ADURING WW1</h1>
<p>1) WOMAN TOOK ON JOBS FOR THE FIRST TIME - This included factory working or agriculture.</p>
<p>2) GAINED FINANCIAL INDEPENDENCE - woman did not have to rely on men any more when it came to money.</p>
<p>3) RIGHT TO VOTE - woman gained the right to vote because many men were at war and they needed someone to vote also many woman were watching all decisions being made and tey were disrupting them unless they were allowed to vote.</p>
<h3>JOBS OF WOMAN IN WW1</h3>
<p>A) AGRICULTURE - They worked on farms, producing food to support the war effort. Organizations like the Women's Land Army were established to recruit women for agricultural work</p>
<p>B) MEDICINE - Women served as nurses, doctors, and support staff in various capacities. They worked in military hospitals, field hospitals, and casualty clearing stations, providing essential medical care to wounded soldiers</p>
<p>C) ENGINEERS - hey worked in munitions factories, assembling weapons and explosives. They also took on roles in transportation, such as driving buses and trains, and in new disciplines like aeronautical and automobile engineering</p>
<p>D) POLICE - : Established by Nina Boyle and Margaret Damer Dawson, the WPS focused on issues affecting women and children. Members of the WPS were volunteers who undertook duties similar to those of male police officers.</p>
<p>E) WEAPONARY - Women were heavily involved in munitions production, working in factories to produce ammunition and other war materials. They handled explosives, operated machinery, and performed various tasks essential to the war effort.</p>
<p>Working in munitions factories during World War I was particularly hazardous for women. They handled dangerous explosives like TNT, which caused severe health issues, turning their skin yellow and earning them the nickname "Canary Girls." Long hours, risky machinery, and the ever-present threat of explosions made these jobs perilous, yet many women undertook them out of a strong sense of duty.</p>
<h3>POSITIVES & NEGATIVES OF THESE JOBS = P/N</h3>
<p>A) P = Britian got its food.  N = Your job is dependent on the weather</p>
<p>B) P = people can get help if they get sick. N = If there is a contagious disease/flu then you are likely to catch it</p>
<p>C) P = You can make things for britian. N = There is a high chance of getting hurt.</p>
<p>D) P = You keep people safe. N = There is a high chance of getting hurt or shot.</p>
<p>E) P = You can help britian win the war. N = There were lots of explosions in this workplace.</p>
<h1>AFTER THE WAR</h1>
<p>Despite all of this, after the war woman went back to their normal/before war lives, but some things did still change.</p>
<p>WOMAN STILL KEPT THE RECORD OF WORKING IN CERTIN PLACES FOR THE 1ST TIME AND FINANCIAL INDEOENDENCE WAS STILL THERE AND SOME PEOPLE STILL KEPT THE RIGHT TO VOTE</p>
<p><strong>NEGATIVES</strong> - many woman lost the right to vote till 1928, many woman lost their jobs and their jobs were given back to men, even if you still kept your job then you would not be paid as much as men. In fact you would get paid less than half.</p>
