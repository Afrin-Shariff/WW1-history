<h1>WOMEN'S ROLE BEFORE WW1</h1>
<p>Before WW1, woman did not have much freedom and it was believed that their place was to stay at home. However, some rebelling woman went aginst the unspoken rules of society and decided to work. This was around 10% of women. Woman would have been stay at home mom, but before they got married there was a chance that they were maids, nannies for rich families or cleaners. Woman would not have even gon near any factories. Woman also had to sit on the fence(was not allowed to vote). In parliament they were treated like outsiders. They rarely protested because it was believed to be the way of life. Despite this a few groups called the suffragetes and the suffrigettes did petition and protest for the right to vote but these groups stopped at the start of the war.</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong> - woman had NO freedom, NO right to vote, MAINLY stayed at home. JOBS = cooking, cleaning, gentle, nurturing, children</p>
<h1>WOMAN'S ROLE ADURING WW1</h1>
<p>1) WOMAN TOOK ON JOBS FOR THE FIRST TIME - This included factory working or agriculture.</p>
<p>2) GAINED FINANCIAL INDEPENDENCE - woman did not have to rely on men any more when it came to money.</p>
<p>3) RIGHT TO VOTE - woman gained the right to vote because many men were at war and they needed someone to vote also many woman were watching all decisions being made and tey were disrupting them unless they were allowed to vote.</p>
<h1>AFTER THE WAR</h1>
<p>Despite all of this, after the war woman went back to their normal/before war lives, but some things did still change.</p>
<p>WOMAN STILL KEPT THE RECORD OF WORKING IN CERTIN PLACES FOR THE 1ST TIME AND FINANCIAL INDEOENDENCE WAS STILL THERE AND SOME PEOPLE STILL KEPT THE RIGHT TO VOTE</p>
<p><strong>NEGATIVES</strong> - many woman lost the right to vote till 1928, many woman lost their jobs and their jobs were given back to men, even if you still kept your job then you would not be paid as much as men. In fact you would get paid less than half.</p>
